A custom firmware generator.
 
  **This is a beta program! We do not hold any responsibility for damage**

# Download Links-

Linux: [Eth3r-Linux](https://github.com/TKO-Cuber/eth3r/releases/download/v0.0.1-beta/Eth3r-Linux.zip)

# Instructions
	- Download this tool either from releases page or `git clone`ing it
	- Prepare a Sn0wbreeze IPSW for your device and desired iOS Version
		- **THIS IPSW HAS TO HAVE A ROOT PARTITION OF 2500 MB!!!**
	- Place this IPSW inside the Files folder of Eth3r
	- Run Eth3r
		- double click Eth3r.bat if on Windows
		- `sudo ./Eth3r-Linux` if on Linux
		- The Linux version is the primarily developed version... the one I work on the most.
	- Follow all instructions, and wait for the IPSW to be generated
	- After the Generation, pwn DFU using Sn0wbreeze
	- Shift+Click `Restore` in iTunes, and locate the Eth3r IPSW
	- Let the restore go through
	- Use `ipwndfu` and do `sudo ./ipwndfu -p` to enter pwned dfu mode
	- run `sudo ./ipwndfu -x` and the device should boot up normally!
