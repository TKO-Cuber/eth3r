# Ether

	A work-in progress custom firmware generator
	
	
	
	
	Currently can generate a custom Root Filesystem and then place it in a Sn0wbreeze IPSW (faster)
	Can also generate a custom Root Filesystem and use ipsw.exe to generate the rest of the firmware (slower)

# Eth3r

A work-in-progress custom firmware generator.
  *Also the first tool/program I've made :)*

 **REQUIRES A BOOTROM EXPLOIT!**
   *Or kloader if you know what you're doing*
  
  *Current release supports the iPhone 3GS on 6.1.3* **only**!
  *More support will come eventually!*
  
  The pretty cool part is that, in theory, this tool *should* work for *any device* as long as you have firmware keys and patches (iBSS, iBEC, ASR, iBoot, and LLB).
    *Currently the firmwares generated are broken... this will be fixed soon*

  # To Do
  
  - Fix firmwares
  - Add support for more devices
  - Add support for verbose boot
  - More customization
  - Custom bootlogos
  - Add tweaks to be pre-installed
